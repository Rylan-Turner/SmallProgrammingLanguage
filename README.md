# SmallProgrammingLanguage

This code was part of a college project that assigned us the task of creating essentially what was a small programming language. 

There is a pdf within this repository named "PLCProjectUserManualTurner" that gives a very brief overview of which tools were used and how to get this project to work. This pdf also shows the output from my code in images. These will match with the test case output examples that are directly from the professor which will be in the TestCases-->OutputExamples folder as the "output1" through "output6" text files. 

There will also be a file with the name of "PLCProjectInstructions" which were the professor's instructions for the project.

This is an old project and the very first large one I did so the documentation is nowhere near my current skills as a result.
